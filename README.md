## Computer Vision assisted Pick Place Robotic Arm and Gripper

This project was done as a part of ROB550 (Robotics Systems Lab) course in University of Michigan

In the project, we employed Kinnect depth sensor and RGB camera to implement block detection and colour detection algorithm

We also developed a trajectory module to generate smooth and safe paths using inverse kinematicsm, obstacle avoidance and path-smoothing algorithms
