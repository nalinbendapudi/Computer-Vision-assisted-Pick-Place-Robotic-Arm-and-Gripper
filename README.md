## Computer Vision assisted Pick Place Robotic Arm and Gripper

This project was done as a part of ROB550 (Robotics Systems Lab) course in University of Michigan

- In the project, we employed Kinnect depth sensor and RGB camera to implement block detection and colour detection algorithm
- We also developed a trajectory module to generate smooth and safe paths using inverse kinematicsm, obstacle avoidance and path-smoothing algorithms
